# Which ERP Implementation Methodology:
```
Did you know that 50% of ERP implementations fail the first time around? Failed implementation can result in wasted software spend and has 
the potential to hurt business profitability. With stakes this high, it’s vital to choose an implementation approach that suits your 
existing IT setup. Selecting the right ERP implementation methodology will significantly reduce implementation errors, help avoid 
unrealistic expectations, and ensure that you stay within budget. In this article, we’ve analyzed the three main ERP implementation 
approaches and suggested a tool that can help you decide which approach is the best for your business.
```

# Key approaches to ERP implementation
There are three key approaches that you can use to implement an ERP system: big bang, phased, and parallel. Each approach has its inherent
advantages and disadvantages. Therefore, you’ll need to thoroughly understand each type to select the one that best caters to your IT setup.

- The big bang approach   (Big Bang)
- The phased approach     (Phased Rollout)
- The parallel approach   (Parallel Adoption)
- Hybrid

# 1. The big bang approach
```
The big bang approach
In the big bang approach, ERP software is deployed for the entire organization in one go. This means that on the go-live date,
the system will be deployed across business functions—manufacturing, operations, sales, finance, marketing, etc.
The big bang approach requires a lot of planning since the software is implemented, in most cases, on a pre-decided date. Also,
the pressure to get things done right is high, as any error can potentially affect all business functions.

In this approach, also referred to as the “single-step method,” all users move to the new system at the same time. You’ll need to have 
completed all configuration and testing of the new system, as well as training, by the go-live date.
The advantage here is that you quickly start realizing ERP benefits, such as higher productivity, better insights and lower 
operating costs. However, once you’ve rolled out the system it’s hard to go back, so it’s critical to get things right. 
Any error or glitch—even a relatively minor one—can impact employees, business partners and customers. There may also be a temporary 
productivity drop as employees get used to the new system.

# 2. The phased approach
```
In this approach, implementation is planned sequentially, with each phase implementing the ERP system for one or more business processes.
You can plan these phases by business department, location, manufacturing facility, and more.
The phased approach takes more time to implement than the big bang method, but it provides a higher degree of safety because errors, 
if any, won’t be impacting all business operations. It also puts less pressure on the implementation team, as there are fewer things 
to worry about during each phase.


Phased rollout
Under a phased approach, the deployment of features, tools and components is done over an extended period, which may cover weeks or months.
This more measured approach can be less risky than the big-bang strategy. It also enables the company to focus first on “quick wins”—the
functions that deliver the most immediate benefits—and to apply learnings from the initial deployment phases to improve the process 
for subsequent phases. But there are drawbacks: It takes longer to get the full benefits of the new ERP, and your company will 
need to support, and pay for, two systems at the same time. There are three primary approaches. Organizations may switch on one 
ERP module, iron out bugs and process issues, and then tackle another phase. Most organizations start with core functions and 
expand from there. Another possibility is to deploy by business unit, such as HR, finance or logistics, and then move forward 
based on needs and hierarchies.The third approach is to phase the rollout by geography. A company might test and perfect the 
system at one location before moving on to other offices, factories or facilities.

# 3. The parallel approach
```
In the parallel approach, a new ERP system is implemented while running legacy systems in parallel.
This minimizes implementation risks, as you can default to the legacy systems in case critical errors come up in the new system.
However, running two systems simultaneously invites technical complexities, such as data synchronization issues. It also adds to 
the cost of implementation, since you’ll be relying on implementation as well as IT experts throughout the process.


Parallel adoption
With this strategy, the organization keeps using its legacy systems in parallel with the new ERP for a specific length of time. 
This is generally considered the least risky approach because it’s possible to revert to the legacy system if you run into problems. 
Because of this safety net, some organizations use this strategy for critical functions that absolutely must always continue operating.
This approach can also make it easier for some users to gradually adjust to the new system. However, parallel adoption can be an 
expensive approach because it requires more staff time and resources to keep two systems running at the same time. And parallel 
adoption can create its own risks: Entering data twice, into two different systems, doubles the chance of errors.
Still, this might be the best bet for companies using a two-tier ERP architecture, a setup often found in firms that
have expanded, whether organically or through mergers and acquisitions.

# Hybrid
```
As the name implies, this approach combines elements of the strategies above. 
For example, an organization might switch on core ERP modules using a big-bang strategy, 
then roll out other modules in phases to specific locations or departments.
